# OpenVirtualSteering-MotionIMU

The **Romans** knew it already: **`"Sterzare Necesse Est"`** (free after Plutarch), and it still holds true in the world of **virtual cycling**.

<details>
<summary>What it means</summary>
The original quote **Navigare Necesse Est** ("Navigation is Necessary") was humorously adapted here by replacing _Navigare_ with the Italian verb for [**Steering**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sterzare), aligning it with the project's theme.

This repo is part of the [**Open Virtual Steering**](https://github.com/yourhubrepo) initiative, a research-driven open-source project exploring **alternative input methods** for **steering in virtual cycling platforms**.

## üß≠ Motion-Based Steering with IMUs

This repository focuses on using an **MPU6050** sensor, a 3-axis accelerometer + 3-axis gyroscope, to detect the rider's **handlebar tilt or lean** and convert that motion into **steering commands**.

- üåÄ **MPU6050**: Low-cost, I¬≤C-compatible motion sensor
- üéÆ **Use case**: Lean or tilt the handlebar to steer the avatar
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Filtering** and **smoothing** algorithms provided

## üîß How it Works

This firmware configures a BLE server to:
1. Pair with a BLE client using a common **steering profile**
2. Continuously sample motion data from the MPU6050
3. Interpret movement into **steering angles**
4. Send steering data to the client at regular intervals

The MPU6050 data is processed using:
- Complementary filtering
- Motion thresholds
- Optional dead zones for stable centering

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Microcontroller Platforms

- **ESP32** (NimBLE-Arduino)
- **nRF52840** (Adafruit Bluefruit)

Tested boards:
- [Adafruit Feather ESP32 V2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400)
- [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062)

## üß™ Testing & Validation

Testing was conducted using [**nRF Connect for Mobile**](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile), a BLE inspection app used to:
- Scan and connect to the BLE server
- Monitor characteristic notifications
- Confirm responsive and smooth steering behavior

The IMU‚Äôs angle mapping was adjusted to ensure **stable, realistic steering behavior** while avoiding overcorrection or jitter from natural hand motion.
