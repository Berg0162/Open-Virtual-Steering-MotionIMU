# OpenVirtualSteering-MotionIMU

The **Romans** knew it already: _"Sterzare Necesse Est!"_ (free after Plutarch), and it still holds true in the world of **virtual cycling**.

<details>
<summary>What it means</summary>
  
The original quote **Navigare Necesse Est** ("To Sail is Necessary") was humorously adapted here by replacing _Navigare_ with the Italian verb for [**steering**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sterzare), aligning it with the project's theme.

This repo is part of the **Open Virtual Steering** initiative, a research-driven open-source project exploring **alternative input methods** for **steering in virtual cycling platforms**.<br>

## üß≠ Motion-Based Steering with _Inertial Measurement Unit_ (IMU)

This repository focuses on using an **MPU-6050 IMU** sensor, a 3-axis accelerometer + 3-axis gyroscope, to detect the rider's **handlebar turning or bike leaning** and convert that motion into **steering commands**. [See Wikipedia for Natural Bike Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_and_motorcycle_dynamics).
- üåÄ **MPU-6050**: Low-cost, I¬≤C-compatible motion sensor
- üéÆ **Use case**: _Shift your weight and lean the bike_ and/or turn the handlebar to steer the avatar
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Filtering** and **smoothing** algorithms provided

## üîß How it Works
This firmware implements a **BLE steering controller** using a standardized protocol observed in commercial steering devices.
It configures a BLE server to:
1. Pair with a BLE client application using a common **steering profile**
2. Continuously sample motion data from the MPU6050
3. Interpret movement into **steering angles**
4. Send steering data to the client at regular intervals

### üåÄ MPU-6050
The MPU-6050 is a 6-axis(combines 3-axis Gyroscope, 3-axis Accelerometer) motion tracking devices. Changes in motion, acceleration and rotation can be detected. It is commonly used in robotics, gaming controllers, and other electronic devices that require motion detection. Its high accuracy and low cost make it very popular among the DIY community. <br>
An MPU-6050 sensor module consists of a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope.
<p align=left><img src="./media/QuadOrientation.png" width="250" height="250" alt="Quad Orientation" align="left"></p><br>
Put MPU-6050 flat on the table, assure that the face with label is upward and a dot on this surface is on the top left corner. Then the upright direction upward is the z-axis of the chip. The direction from left to right is regarded as the X-axis. Accordingly the direction from back to front is defined as the Y-axis. The MPU-6050‚Äôs onboard Digital Motion Processor (<b>DMP</b>) offloads processing that would normally have to take place on the microprocessor. It maintains an internal buffer that combines data from the gyro and accelerometer and computes orientation. The <b>DMP</b> also takes care of the applying the offsets.<br>

A comprehensive description of the MPU-6050 can be found on [MPU-6050 Explained](https://mjwhite8119.github.io/Robots/mpu6050).<br>
The <b>DMP</b> pre-processed MPU-6050 data is next handled in firmware code using:
- Complementary filtering
- Motion thresholds
- Optional dead zones for stable centering

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Microcontroller Platforms

- **ESP32** (NimBLE-Arduino)
- **nRF52840** (Adafruit Bluefruit)

Tested boards:
- [Adafruit Feather ESP32 V2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400)
- [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062)

## üß™ Testing & Validation

Testing was conducted using [**nRF Connect for Mobile**](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile), a BLE inspection app used to:
- Scan and connect to the BLE server
- Monitor characteristic notifications
- Confirm responsive and smooth steering behavior

The IMU‚Äôs angle mapping was adjusted to ensure **stable, realistic steering behavior** while avoiding overcorrection or jitter from natural bike motion.

# üî¥ Motion Sensor: Inertial Measuring Unit, MPU6050

This device is enabling <b>natural steering</b> movements with your handlebars and your body position! Body position (a.k.a. leaning) only when your indoor bike setup allows for (with a rocker plate). The present code is optimized for steering during the heavy wobbling conditions of a low cost (DIY) rocker plate!<br> 
<b>Wobbling -> Noise -> Spurious Sensor Drift!</b><br> 
It was a challenge to separate steering from natural cycling movements (bike wobbling). With a rocker plate bike setup, steering is as natural as possible. Leaning to the right or left is detected in combination with turning the handlebars and amplifies the effect on the avatar!<br>
<img src="./media/MPU-6050 2-600x600w.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="MPU6050" align="left">

The very low cost MPU6050 is connected to the board with I2C:

```C++
#include <MPU6050_light.h>
// Instantiate MPU6050 sensor
MPU6050 mpu(Wire);
```
<br clear="left">
A SSD1306 display is connected the same way:

```C++ 
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>
#include "Adafruit_SSD1306_Icons.h"

// Declaration for an SSD1306 display connected to I2C (SDA, SCL pins)
#define SCREEN_WIDTH 128              // OLED display width, in pixels
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64              // OLED display height, in pixels
#define OLED_RESET     -1             // Reset pin # (or -1 if sharing Arduino reset pin)
Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);
```
